# Healthcare-Project

About
This website facilitates 8 end-to-end Machine Learning and Deep Learning model built upon Healthcare datasets that can be used to predict whether a person is suffering from a particular disease or not

Significance/Impact
This website is a simple demonstration of how the power of AI can be leveraged in the field of Healthcare. Whenever a patient undergoes testing for a certain disease, he had to get his reports analysed by the doctor

This idea can help us: 
Reduce dependancy on the doctors, and help patients get diagnosed in minimal time and at his/her own convenience
Help people avoid paying huge amount to doctors for consultation and diagnosis
Extend the role of technology in healthcare
